Question:
Android Studio Error:Gradle DSL method not found:'has()'

Answerï¼š
The Volley project has given the following warning for a while now:

The has() method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in Gradle 3.0. Please use the hasProperty() or ext.has() method instead.
Changing the line in Volley's bintray.gradle file from

publish = project.has("release")
to

publish = project.hasProperty("release")
Seems to fix the issue
